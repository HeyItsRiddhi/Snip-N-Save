# Snip-N-Save
A chrome extension that allows you to easily copy/paste code &amp; save important code snippets for reference from a variety of websites i.e stack overflow.


Overview

Snip-N-Save is designed to simplify the process of locating code snippets from a webpage and saving that code with a tag for future use. Many times we came across important code snippets for class, personal projects, or work, and needed a way to copy, paste, and save on the fly. We support the following websites:

  - stack overflow (fully supported)
  - google developers (fully supported)
  - mozilla developer network
  - microsoft developer network
  - national public mania np
